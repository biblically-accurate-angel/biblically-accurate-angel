- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pan_to_the_head
- I am 13 years old.
- I have zero computer knowledge.
- I have absolutely no clue what any of this means.
- I use the phrase "hello, world!" often in conceptual writing.
- I know it has something to do with code.
- When you're writing a program, or making a robot or a computer or something, the first thing you make it say is "hello, world!".
- And that's really cool. "hello, world!" is like a universal greeting to existence. Literally a "hello" to the world.
- I'll be trying learn some stuff about these 'puters.
- Toodles.
